# Episode Images

Place episode cover images here. Each episode should have a corresponding WebP image:

- `episode-001.webp` through `episode-020.webp`
- `og-image.webp` for social sharing
- Recommended dimensions: 800x800px for episode covers, 1200x630px for og-image
- Keep file sizes under 100KB each for optimal performance

## Placeholder Generation

Until real images are added, you can:
1. Use a design tool (Figma, Canva) to create 800x800px covers
2. Use placeholder services temporarily
3. Convert existing images to WebP using online tools or ImageMagick

Example ImageMagick command:
```bash
convert input.jpg -resize 800x800 -quality 85 episode-001.webp
```
